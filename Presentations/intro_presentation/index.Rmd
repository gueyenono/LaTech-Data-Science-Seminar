## Important advice!

### Do related work inside RStudio projects!!!

1. Create a folder in which your work will reside.

2. File > New Project > Existing directory > Create Project


### Be organized. Create a directory for similar files!!!

E.g. Data, Plots, Documents, Media, R scripts...

---

### .center[Use lots of comments for your future self!!!]

Comments are chunks of text which are not executed by R. They are used to guide the user in the code. Comments are preceded by a `#` symbol.
