 # A few facts about the Titanic

---

class: center, middle

- Full name: Royal Mail Ship (RMS) Titanic

- Length: 269m (882.5 feet)

- Width: 28.2m (92.5 feet)

- Carrying capacity: 46,328 tons

- Was built in Belfast (Ireland)

- Many claimed that the Titanic was unsinkable (source: [www.britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Titanic))

- The Titanic sank during its .red[maiden voyage].

- Date of the tragedy: April 14-15, 1912

# Initial setup

## Be very organized in your work!

---

A- Create a folder in a location of your choice: .red[`Data_Science_Seminar`].

- Let it be the master folder for everything you do in the seminar.
    
- Avoid \*spaces\* when you name things.

--

B- Create a subfolder inside the master folder for the analysis of the Titanic data: .red[`titanic_analysis`].

- This is where everything related to the analysis will reside: 
    
- Creating sub-folders for similar file types is a very good habit to have: R scripts, graphs, data, reports, ...

--

C- `titanic_analysis` is the **root folder/directory** of our project. We need to make sure RStudio knows it!

- Open RStudio (the top-right corner should say: "Project: (None)").
    
- File > New project > Existing directory > Browse...
    
- ... Look for the `titanic_analysis` folder and click on it.
    
- Click the "Open" button.
    
- Click the "Create project" button.

---

class: center

- The top-right corner of RStudio should now have: `titanic_analysis` - the name of your project.

- The actual `titanic-analysis` root folder has a new file with the same name (with the extension *R Project*).

- Now RStudio recognizes the folder you created as the root folder of your project!

--


### .red[Time to download the data into our root folder]

Place it in a subfolder called .red[data].

Link: [titanic.csv](http://bit.ly/2po1gQu)

--

### .red[Exercise]

Create a new folder called `fastfood_nutrition` and make it the root folder of an RStudio project!

Link: [fastfood_calories.csv](http://bit.ly/2NqGnmd)

## Let's Get to Know our Data

---

class: left

- The data is a .red[data frame].

- Each column is a **variable**.

- Each row is an **observation**.

--

.pull-left[
- .blue[`PassengerId`]: Identification number of each passenger.

- .blue[`Survived`]:

    - 0: did not survive
    
    - 1: survived

- .blue[`Pclass`]: Passenger class

    - 1: first class
    
    - 2: second class
    
    - 3: third class

- .blue[`Name`]: Name of each passenger

- .blue[`Sex`]: Gender of each passenger
]

.pull-right[
- .blue[`Age`]: Age of each passenger

- .blue[`SibSp`]: Siblings and spouse

- .blue[`Parch`]: Parents and children

- .blue[`Ticket`]: Ticket number

- .blue[`Fare`]: Price paid for the voyage

- .blue[`Cabin`]: Cabin number

- .blue[`Embarked`]: City of origin

    - S: Southampton (England)

## Create a new R script

File > New File > R Script

This is where you'll write all your code!

---

class: big-font

## Installing a package

- R comes with many packages.

- Many more are developed by the community and made available for free!

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("readr") # For importing data into R
install.packages("dplyr") # For manipulating data
install.packages("ggplot2") # For visualizing data
```

Execute the code with:

- `Ctrl + Enter` (Windows)

- `Cmd + Enter` (Mac)

.red[Once a package is installed once, it's installed forever!]

---

class: big-font

## Loading a package

- Loading a package = opening the toolbox

- Need to do it whenever you need to use the tools inside the package

--

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, comment = NA}
library(readr) # For importing data into R
library(dplyr) # For manipulating data
library(ggplot2) # For visualizing data
```

---

class: inverse, center, middle

# Import the data

---

class: big-font

## `read_csv` (in the `readr` package)

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, comment = NA}
read_csv("data/titanic.csv")
```

---

class: big-font

The data set can be stored inside .red[a variable].

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, comment = NA}
titanic <- read_csv("data/titanic.csv")
titanic
```

Now, the .red[variable] shows up in the .blue[environment].
